Sentiment analysis of Internet memes

This project is divided into two tasks:
1.	First, it is a multi-class classification called “meme_task1”. It contains machine learning classifiers and code for resampling dataset.
I.	Download the required dataset from “labels.csv” in local drive.
II.	Undo the comment and select the desired dataset to train ML classifier.
III.	Undo the comment and select different input X and output y to train NN classifier.

2.	Second, the multi-label classification was implemented by ML-KNN and RNNs
with different feature representation.
I.	Download the required dataset from “labels.csv” in local drive.
II.	Manipulate the k value from {5,10,15} to train ML-KNN in the model pipeline.
III.	Select different NN structure to predict multi-label memes.
